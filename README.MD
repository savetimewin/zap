This is my very first game that I have created during the Summer of 2022.

Zap is minimalist survival shooter built in Pygame: you pilot a neon pink circle in an 800×600 arena, dodge procedurally spawned squares that constantly home toward the screen center, and fire 8‑way lasers with WASD/ZQECX inputs to clear space. The game tracks how long you last, ramps spawn rate and speed as minutes pass, and offers a simple start screen plus a “Try Again?” game-over loop so you can chase longer survivals.

Looking back now in Dec 2025:

Future implementation consider for the improvement of the game:

Add a point system where taking less steps to dodge awards points or less penalty.
Add a center boundary area that grants more points.
Slow down the spawn rate and speed of squares and have them bounce back when hitting the edge.
Add a leaderboard to see who had most points and longest survival time as well as add your own records.
